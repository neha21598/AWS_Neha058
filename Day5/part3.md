# Difference Between EC2 vs RDS
## EC2
> + Ec2 is get managed by the aws.
> + But, if you install any application within ec2 or in ec2 then it is get managed by the developer.
> + For ex, If I make ec2 then all RAM ,processor should be work this maintenance is get managed by the aws.
> + But ,if we installed java or mysql into it then,if it is not working properly(any application like the mysql)
Then,for that aws is not responsible.
**That are not get managed by the aws.**

## RDS
> + In RDS,it also asks for the RAM ,processor.then it allows to install the mysql server.
> + If I want space of mysql of 20 gb then they not charge for it
And this ysql server is get fully managed by the aws.
> + So we don’t get the prolems like outage etc.
> + All thingslike automatically bakup or maintaiance are get managed by the aws.
> + And also scalability like scale up or down is get managed by the aws.
> + If data is growing then aws automatically gives us the more space.





### serverless
> + You don’t own a server
> + zero maintainance
> + Automatic scalability
